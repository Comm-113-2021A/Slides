## Sharing / reusing code policy

.pull-left-wide[
- We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted.

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. Google, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s). 

- Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source.

## Late work

.pull-left-wide[
- For reasons outside of illness, family circumstances, and other exigencies, you will lose 5 percent per day late

## Getting help

.pull-left-wide[
- **Piazza** for course content, logistics, etc. discussion on the course discussion forum

- **Office hours** for real-time video chat

- Most importantly, ask questions, don't worry about whether you're choosing the right medium / format.

## Diversity & inclusion

.pull-left-wide[
- **Intent:** Present materials and activities that are respectful of all axes of diversity.

- Let me know if you have preferred name and pronouns.

- Reach out if your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class.

- I am always in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me know.

## Learning during a pandemic

.pull-left-wide[
- Life sucks right now!

- I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.

- You *never* owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I canâ€™t help, I likely know someone who can.

- I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.
