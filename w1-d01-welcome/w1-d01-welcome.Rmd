## Data science

.pull-left-wide[
- Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. 

- We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics $\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

**Q: Why not language X?**  
A: We can discuss that over `r emo::ji("coffee")`.

## AE 01 - First dataviz and introductions

Go into breakout rooms. 
Introduce yourselves: name, hobby, where you are currently living, first thing you'll do post-pandemic, what you find interesting/intriguing (if anything) about data science, one thing a prof has done to make (zoom) class a better experience, one thing a prof has done to make (zoom) class a worse experience. 

Add details here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13ZluIiTTTlpx-avTXphqSnTc50MrQqPZnhkiNzif6CQ/edit?usp=sharing

Then, do one of the following exercises. 

You have two options for this exercise:

- Option 1: Voting patterns of countries in the UN General Assembly

- Option 2: COVID-19 fatality numbers across the globe

Pick one and complete it. Optionally, try the other one as well.

.your-turn[
**Option 1.**

- Go to [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) and start `AE 01a - First dataviz - UN Votes`.
- In the Files pane (bottom right corner), spot the file called `unvotes.Rmd`. 
- Open it and click "Knit".
- Then...
  - Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
  - Change the country names to those you're interested in. Spelling and capitalization must match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to confirm spelling. 
  - Knit again. Voila, your first data visualization!
